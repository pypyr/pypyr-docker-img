# note ENTRYPOINT is still pypyr, meaning you can run this container as if it's
# the pypyr binary.
# be aware that the WORKDIR is NOT the GOPATH.
# the WORKDIR is /src, which is the pypyr working dir. this will let you mount a
# volume with a pipelines dir in it without hiding the go path.
# build me like this from repo root:
# docker build -t pypyr/pypyr-go-terraform -t pypyr/pypyr-go-terraform:latest -t pypyr/pypyr-go-terraform:0.11 -t pypyr/pypyr-go-terraform:0.11.8 -f pypyr-go-terraform/Dockerfile .
